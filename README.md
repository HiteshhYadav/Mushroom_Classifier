## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a machine learning classifier trained on a mushroom dataset to classify mushrooms into:

- ✅ Edible  
- ❌ Poisonous  

The project includes:
- `app.py` – Main application file (Flask app + model logic)
- `mushrooms.csv` – Dataset used for training/testing
- `requirements.txt` – Required Python dependencies

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains multiple categorical features such as:
- Cap shape
- Cap color
- Odor
- Gill size
- Gill color
- Habitat  
…and more.

Each record is labeled as **edible** or **poisonous**.
